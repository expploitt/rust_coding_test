# Rust Coding test

@expploitt

The command to launch the application is

```
$ cargo run -- transactions.csv > accounts.csv
```


## Assumptions

- For the amount input I decided to floor at fourth decimal.

## Test

For testing purposes I wrote some examples. I try to validate the outputs with the outputs I thought that must be correct
from my understanding .
